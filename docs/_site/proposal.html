<p><strong>InvestTrack: A Learning Tool to Follow Investors and Market Trends</strong></p>

<h1 id="description">Description:</h1>
<p>InvestTrack is a web application designed to help beginner and student investors learn how professional investors operate in the stock market. The app will allow users to view stock market data, track the current and past holdings of well-known investors, and follow their strategic changes over time. Unlike platforms like eToro or TipRanks, this app is geared toward <strong>education</strong>, not financial advice or real-time trading.</p>

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose:</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to provide a <strong>student-friendly and educational</strong> tool that makes investment strategies easier to understand by following real investor behavior through publicly available data (e.g., SEC 13F filings). This app bridges the gap between abstract financial theory and real-world investment decision-making.</p>

<p>1) Key Features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stock market search: users can search any ticker and view current price, company info, and changes.</li>
  <li>Investor profiles: view past vs. present portfolios of selected investors (e.g., Warren Buffett).</li>
  <li>Follow system: users can “follow” investors and view their portfolio dashboard.</li>
  <li>Portfolio visualization: simple charts and comparisons for better learning.</li>
</ul>

<p>2)Similar Solutions</p>

<p>Several existing platforms offer stock tracking or investor-following features:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>TipRanks</strong> – Provides stock analysis, analyst ratings, and top investor portfolios, but requires a subscription for most data.</li>
  <li><strong>eToro</strong> – A social trading platform that allows users to copy trades from other investors, but is focused on real-time trading.</li>
  <li><strong>WhaleWisdom</strong> – Focuses on SEC 13F filings, letting users follow institutional investors. It is data-heavy and not very beginner-friendly.</li>
</ul>

<p>While these platforms are built for active investors or professionals, <strong>InvestTrack</strong> is designed for <strong>students and beginners</strong>. Its goal is <strong>education</strong>, not financial advice or active trading. It simplifies complex financial data into digestible insights and encourages learning through exploration, not speculation.</p>

<p>3) Technologies &amp; Tools:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> React.js (Vite or Create React App)</li>
  <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Node.js (Express) or Firebase for quick MVP</li>
  <li><strong>APIs:</strong> Alpha Vantage (for stock data), public 13F filings (or Whalewisdom)</li>
  <li><strong>Database:</strong> Firebase or PostgreSQL (to store followed investors, saved stocks)</li>
</ul>

<p>4)Learning Load</p>

<p>This project involves learning several new technologies and tools. I’ve used some basic JavaScript before, but React (with Vite or Create React App) will be new, especially JSX and component structure. I haven’t worked with APIs like Alpha Vantage or SEC 13F data before, so learning how to fetch and parse that data will be part of the challenge. If I use Firebase, I’ll need to learn how to set up real-time databases and authentication. Jekyll and GitHub Pages are also new to me, so deploying the site and managing updates using GitHub Actions will require exploration. Overall, this project will help me build full-stack skills, improve my Git/GitHub workflow, and get hands-on experience with real-world data.</p>

<p>5) Deliverables:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Working web app with core features</li>
  <li>GitHub repo with version control and commits</li>
  <li>Published project site using GitHub Pages and Jekyll</li>
  <li>Final presentation with demo + learning reflection</li>
</ul>
