# Step 3: Continuous Integration (CI)

Use **GitHub Actions** to run tests automatically on every push.

## Add Workflow File
Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI Test
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run test
```
