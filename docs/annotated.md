# Annotated Bibliography

## [1] U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission – “EDGAR – Search Tools”  
**Link:** https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/  
**Type:** Primary source – official U.S. government site  
**Relation to App:** Core data source for investor filings (13F).  
**Annotation:**  
The SEC’s EDGAR database provides official financial filings submitted by institutional investors, including 13F filings that disclose portfolio holdings. This will be a core data source for my app, allowing users to track real investor behavior. Since the information is legally mandated and regularly updated, it adds credibility and transparency. Parsing these filings will teach me how to extract real-world data from structured documents.

## [2] WhaleWisdom – “13F Filings, Hedge Fund Holdings, and Mutual Fund Ownership”  
**Link:** https://whalewisdom.com  
**Type:** Secondary aggregator site  
**Relation to App:** Competing platform  
**Annotation:**  
WhaleWisdom aggregates 13F filings and presents them with investor ranking tools, performance metrics, and trends. It focuses on institutional investing and power users. Although powerful, it’s not beginner-friendly. This shows a gap for educational tools aimed at students, which my app can fill by simplifying data and providing context instead of focusing on financial returns.

## [3] TipRanks – “Stock Analysis and Portfolio Tools”  
**Link:** https://www.tipranks.com  
**Type:** Commercial service  
**Relation to App:** Competing platform  
**Annotation:**  
TipRanks offers detailed stock analytics, analyst ratings, and investor tracking, but it’s mostly locked behind a subscription. It’s a tool built for active traders, not students or beginners. My app will take inspiration from TipRanks’ presentation of investor portfolios but aim to be simpler, free, and focused on learning—not trading or subscriptions.

## [4] eToro – “Social Trading Platform”  
**Link:** https://www.etoro.com  
**Type:** Commercial trading platform  
**Relation to App:** Comparable, but different focus  
**Annotation:**  
eToro enables users to copy the trades of successful investors in real time. It’s focused on live financial trading and encourages investment behaviors, which is not aligned with my educational goals. My app will not offer real-time trading but instead help users understand investor logic, historical decisions, and patterns using mock dashboards.

## [5] Alpha Vantage – “Stock APIs for Realtime and Historical Market Data”  
**Link:** https://www.alphavantage.co  
**Type:** Developer tool/API  
**Relation to App:** Core tool for stock data  
**Annotation:**  
Alpha Vantage provides free APIs for real-time and historical market data. It’s well-documented and beginner-accessible, making it ideal for educational apps. I plan to use this API to power my stock search and price display features, giving users current prices and basic financial metrics. It will be key for integrating real stock info without needing a paid data plan.
